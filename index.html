    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>I love learning new things!! Since technology is always changing I love having the opportunity to always be learning something new as I study in this field!</p><hr>
    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><a href='https://learn.codechangers.com'>CoderKeys</a></li>
        <p>This was an app that I created in a 24 coding competition to teach students how to type specific keys that are specific to programming. For example, %, $, |.</p>
        <p>It allows people to track their WPM and even shows what the code that they are typing does in real life. Finally, it has some fun typing games!!</p>
        <li><a href='https://waffletech.dev'>WaffleTech</a></li>
        <p>This is a business that me and my brother set up to try and build websites for others around us because everyone wants the opportunity to market their ideas to the world!</p>
        <li>Spot'n Tap</li>
        <p>I love building little games for mobile as well and one that I have helped build is called Spot'n Tap, which is a sort of matching game</p>
